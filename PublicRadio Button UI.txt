Tuning Functionality

-Radio ships pre-tuned, frequency stored in EEPROM 
-Tactile switch allows for manual retuning, saving and overwriting old station. 
-Due to international orders, the valid frequency range is the entire FM band of the IC (76-108 MHZ).

User Feedback Options
-Audio
	o Listening to a station as you tune to verify.
-LED
	o Provides feedback based on which tuning mode the user is relying on:
		* Manual Re-tune Mode
		* Scan Mode 
		* Save Mode 
		* Timed Out Mode

LED Displays

-Tune Mode = 1000ms HIGH, 1000ms LOW
-Scan Mode = 80ms   HIGH, 80ms   LOW 
-Save Mode = 300ms  HIGH, 300ms  LOW 
				*followed by*

Tuning Modes

-Begin Manual re-tune
	o Initialized by a >= 2 second button depress.  
	o LED loops tuning mode display until new command is called.
	o Single button presses >= 300 ms apart increments station frequency 
      by 100Khz.
    o FM band wrapped at 76 & 108 Mhz. 

-Scan Mode 
	o Initialized by *2* button presses <300 ms apart. 
	o LED loops scan mode display *5* times.
	o Radio scans up to next available frequency.  
	o Returns to Manual Re-tune Mode.

-Save Mode 
	o Initialized by a >= 2 sec button depress.
	o Led loops save mode display *2* times.
	o Frequency is stored as the new default station.

-Timed Out Mode
	o Initialized by >=10 seconds of no user input.
	o Led loops timed out mode display *20* times. 
	o Breaks from Timed Out Mode if button depress received from user and  
	  	*returns to manual re-tune mode.
	o If no new command is called radio returns to last programmed station.
		*LED resumes PWM display of station reception.
